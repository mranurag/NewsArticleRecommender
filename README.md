# NewsArticleRecommender
A complete implementation of recommendation engine using probabilistic approach.
In this Python notebook, we are implementing a recommenadtion engine from scratch by just using the news article data. It is a bit different as normal recommendation assumptions such as popularity don't hold true. We don't want to show a 100 days old news just because it is popular.
We are generating the user clickstream data using some probability assumptions .
The important thing to note is that we can't use ratings here as nobody stays to give ratings to an article :)
